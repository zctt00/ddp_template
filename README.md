# PyTorch Template Using DistributedDataParallel

This is a seed project for distributed PyTorch training, which was built to customize your network quickly. 

### Overview

Here is an overview of what this template can do, and most of them can be customized by the configure file.

### Features

- distributed training using DistributedDataParallel
- base class for extensibility
- `.json` configure file for most parameter tuning
- support multiple networks/losses/metrics definition
- debug mode for fast test ðŸŒŸ

------
### Usage

#### You Need to Know 

1. cuDNN default settings are as follows for training, which may reduce your code reproducibility! Notice it to avoid unexpected behaviors.

```python
 torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = True
 # speed-reproducibility tradeoff https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html
 if seed >=0 and gl_seed>=0:  # slower, more reproducible
     torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
     torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
 else:  # faster, less reproducible, default setting
     torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = False
     torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
```

2. The project allows custom classes/functions and parameters by configure file. You can define dataset, losses, networks, etc. by the specific format. Take the `network` as an example:

```yaml
// import Network() class from models.network.py file with args
"which_networks": [
	{
    	"name": ["models.network", "Network"],
    	"args": { "init_type": "kaiming"}
	}
],

// import mutilple Networks from defualt file with args
"which_networks": [ 
    {"name": "Network1", args: {"init_type": "kaiming"}},
    {"name": "Network2", args: {"init_type": "kaiming"}},
],

// import mutilple Networks from defualt file without args
"which_networks" : [
    "Network1", // equivalent to {"name": "Network1", args: {}},
    "Network2"
]

// more details can be found on More Details part and init_objs function in praser.py
```



#### Start

Run the `run.py` with your setting.

```python
python run.py
```

More choices can be found on `run.py` and `config/base.json`.


#### Customize Dataset

Dataset part decides the data need to be fed into the network, you can define the dataset by following steps:

1. Put your dataset under `data` folder. See `dataset.py` in this folder as an example.
2. Edit the **\[dataset\]\[train|test\]** part in `config/base.json` to import and initialize dataset. 

```yaml
"datasets": { // train or test
    "train": { 
            "which_dataset": {  // import designated dataset using args 
            "name": ["data.dataset", "Dataset"], 
            "args":{ // args to init dataset
                "data_root": "/data/jlw/datasets/comofod"
            } 
        },
        "dataloader":{
        	"validation_split": 0.1, // percent or number
            "args":{ // args to init dataloader
                "batch_size": 2, // batch size in every gpu
                "num_workers": 4,
                "shuffle": true,
                "pin_memory": true,
                "drop_last": true
            }
        }
    },
}
```

##### More details

- You can import dataset from a new file. Key `name` can be a list to show your file name and class/function name, or a single string to explain class name in default file(`data.dataset.py`). An example is as follows:

```yaml
"name": ["data.dataset", "Dataset"], // import Dataset() class from data.dataset.py
"name": "Dataset", // import Dataset() class from default file
```

- You can control and record more parameters through configure file. Take `data_root`  as the example, you just need to add it in `args` dict and edit the corresponding class to parse this value:

```yaml
"args":{ // args to init dataset
    "data_root": "your data path"
} 
```

```python
class Dataset(data.Dataset):
	def __init__(self, data_root, phase='train', image_size=[256, 256], loader=pil_loader):
		imgs = make_dataset(data_root) # data_root value is from configure file
```



#### Customize Network

Network part shows your learning network structure, you can define your network by following steps:

1. Put your network under `models` folder. See `network.py` in this folder as an example.
2. Edit the **\[model\][which_networks]** part in `config/base.json` to import and initialize your networks, and it is a list. 

```yaml
"which_networks": [ // import designated list of networks using args
    {
        "name": "Network",
        "args": { // args to init network
            "init_type": "kaiming" 
        }
    }
],
```
##### More details

- You can import networks from a new file. Key `name` can be a list to show your file name and class/function name, or a single string to explain class name in default file(`models.network.py` ). An example is as follows:

```yaml
"name": ["models.network", "Network"], // import Network() class from models.network.py
"name": "Network", // import Network() class from default file
```

- You can control and record more parameters through configure file. Take `init_type`  as the example, you just need to add it in `args` dict and edit corresponding class to parse this value:

```yaml
"args": { // args to init network
    "init_type": "kaiming" 
}
```

```python
class BaseNetwork(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, init_type='kaiming', gain=0.02):
		super(BaseNetwork, self).__init__() # init_type value is from configure file
class Network(BaseNetwork):
	def __init__(self, in_channels=3, **kwargs):
    	super(Network, self).__init__(**kwargs) # get init_type value and pass it to base network
```

- You can import multiple networks. You should import the networks in configure file and use it in model.

```yaml
"which_networks": [ 
    {"name": "Network1", args: {}},
    {"name": "Network2", args: {}},
],
```




#### Customize Model(Trainer)

Model part shows your training process including optimizers/losses/process control, etc.  You can define your model by following steps:

1. Put your Model under `models` folder. See `model.py` in its folder as an example.
2. Edit the **\[model\][which_model]** part in `config/base.json` to import and initialize your model.

```yaml
"which_model": { // import designated  model(trainer) using args 
    "name": ["models.model", "Model"],
    "args": { // args to init model
    } 
}, 
```

##### More details

- You can import model from a new file. Key `name` can be a list to show your file name and class/function name, or a single string to explain class name in default file(`models.model.py` ). An example is as follows:

```yaml
"name": ["models.model", "Model"], // import Model() class / function(not recommend) from models.model.py (default is [models.model.py])
"name": "Model", // import Model() class from default file
```

- You can control and record more parameters through configure file. Please infer to above  `More details` part.


##### Losses and Metrics

Losses and Metrics are defined on configure file. You also can control and record more parameters through configure file, please refer to the above  `More details` part.

```yaml
"which_metrics": ["mae"], 
"which_losses": ["mse_loss"] 
```

##### Optimizers and Schedulers

Optimizers and schedulers will import modules from `torch.optim` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler`, respectively, and you need to define type and arguments to initialization. An example is as follows:

```json
"which_optimizers": [ 
    { "name": "Adam", "args":{ "lr": 0.001, "weight_decay": 0}}
],
"which_lr_schedulers": [
    { "name": "StepLR", "args": { "step_size": 50, "gamma": 0.1 }}
],
```

If you need multiple optimizers and schedulers, optimizers, schedulers and networks must be the same length in order to correspond one-to-one. Blank dictionaries will be deleted.



After the above steps, you need to rewrite several functions like  `base_model.py/model.py` for your network and dataset. 

##### Init step

See `__init__()` functions as the example.

##### Training/validation step

See `train_step()/val_step()` functions as the example.

##### Checkpoint/Resume training

See `save_everything()/load_everything()` functions as the example.



#### Debug mode

Sometimes we hope to debug the process quickly to ensure the whole project works, so debug mode is necessary.

This mode will reduce the dataset size and speed up the training process. You just need to run the file with -d option and edit the debug dict in configure file.

```python
python run.py -d
```

```yaml
"debug": { // args in debug mode, which will replace args in train
    "val_epoch": 1,
    "save_checkpoint_epoch": 1,
    "log_iter": 30,
    "data_len": 50 // percent or number, change the size of dataloder to debug_split.
}
```



#### Customize More
